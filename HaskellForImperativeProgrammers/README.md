A series of exercises from the youtube series [Haskell For Imperative Programmers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgu82wiiZ90&list=PLe7Ei6viL6jGp1Rfu0dil1JH1SHk9bgDV)

If your interested in learning Haskell, I recomend this as a wonderful resource! I have found the videos to be helpful and accessible, 
and enjoy the fact that the series works to encorporate practice using the language into the learning process.
